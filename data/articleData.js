        If you ask a random kid anywhere in India, what sports does he know of?
        The most likely answer will be in this order: Cricket, Football,
        Kabaddi, Badminton
      </p>

      <p>
        Or just a permutation of this. Why? Due to the extreme popularity of
        leagues like the Indian Premier League, Indian Super League, Pro
        Kabaddi, etc. These leagues have now rooted in nearly every household
        and people consume them for different reasons. Some sports enthusiasts
        watch it for the love of the sport, some for passing time, some for
        minting money while others just because there is nothing else to watch.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what about boxing? One of that sports where India has been winning
        an Olympic medal in many editions of the game now. Boxing has given
        India legends like Mary Kom, Vijender Singh, Sarita Devi, Lovlina
        Borgohain, Hawa Singh and many more. On 19 May 2022, Nikhat Zareen won
        the gold medal in the 52kg category at the Women‚Äôs World Championship
        making the country proud yet again. While this is the case, the
        penetration of the sport in India still lacks, and we see a majority of
        the professional world-class Indian boxers come only from a few
        regions/states of the nation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tide needs to change as there is a lot of potential in the country
        which can be nurtured to boxing greats. TIAR is planning, organizing and
        presenting to you all, a one-of-its-kind professional boxing league
        wherein boxers from all over the country will fight it out for the
        coveted title, helped and mentored by world-renowned coaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hellsbay Fight League (HFL) is a one-of-its-kind decentralized pro
        boxing league created by TIAR for the people. We have brought the Indian
        Boxing Council (IBC) onboard with us to support our vision and take this
        great initiative forward. The league is all set to happen in October,
        where 36 professional boxers will fight for the title. There will be 6
        teams, and 3 categories each having 6 players. Indian boxers from the
        weight range of 54kg to 80kg will be allowed to register, as the 6
        franchise DAO will then pick their teams from this pool of boxers.
      </p>

      <p>
        HFL is unique in the sense that it plans to decentralize the entire
        experience and allow boxing fans to actually take part in the league in
        form of decision making, player and venue selections. People‚Äôs ownership
        ‚Äî as we like to call it, is what TIAR believes every league-based sport
        will head into the future. Each of the 6 teams will be jointly owned by
        1500 NFT holders. And thus, a total of 9000 Wardroids NFT Collection
        will be up for grabs which will then give the holders the partial
        ownership of one of the teams. Using decentralized autonomous
        organizations or DAOs as they are usually called, the holders will vote
        on any decision related to the team.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 6 Fight Clubs (FC) competing in the league would be : Mumbai
        Warriors FC, Chennai Heroes FC, Hyderabad Knights FC, Kolkata Conquerors
        FC, Delhi Guardians FC, Bangalore Berserkers FC . Each of teams will be
        mentored by legendary combat sports coaches like Javier Mendez, Mike
        Swick and Anthony Pettis. The guides will be the bridge between the
        boxers and the club owners who are part of the DAO by holding the
        Wardroids NFTs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The league will also present the top performing boxers with
        international opportunities starting with a WBC India Title match. Out
        of the 36 Boxers, the top 6 Boxers (2 boxers per weight category) who
        score the most points during the league will get a chance to fight and
        become a WBC India Champion in 3 different weight categories: Super
        Bantam, Light Weight and Middle Weight
      </p>

      <p>
        This setting of the league will generate for the sport multiple revenue
        streams, sponsors, and the required popularity and reach to the youth of
        the nation. With the help of a Pay-Per-View platform, TIAR will stream
        all matches live on the OTT platform. Every match will have a big purse
        for the boxers too. All licensed boxers registered with the IBC will be
        eligible to participate in the league.
      </p>

      <p>
        HFL is all set to revolutionize the way boxing is perceived, created and
        consumed in India. And TIAR is doing everything in its power to make it
        a smooth and worthy experience for each one of you.

        But if you ask yourself what sport is to you, the answer might differ.
        For some, it would be a source of income, for some just a way to pass
        time. Few of us might indulge in playing it, while a lot of us might be
        enjoying just watching it. But each of us do have some memories
        associated with it. Sports brings together people and unites them.
        Remember those iconic goals of Lionel Messi while he was at Barcelona?
        Or famous MS Dhoni six to seal the ODI Cricket World Cup for India on
        2nd April 2011? Or Canelo‚Äôs upper cut vs Saunders? The entire nation was
        backing them, we were all cheering for them and the sport gave us those
        moments to cherish.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine if you were to own a unique, rare, collectible copy of these
        great sporting moments? On your name, etched forever? Sounds cool right?
        Well, that is what is happening in the world of NFTs right now. There
        are many up and coming platforms that allow you to own sporting moments,
        artefacts, player cards, etc. trade them and use them in games. A few of
        them are: NBA Top Shots, UFC Strike, LaligaOnFlow, SoRare, Ethernity and
        Fancraze
      </p>

      <p>
        The top 15 sports NFTs are all listed for over $1 Million Dollars on
        various marketplaces. For instance, ‚ÄúStatue of LeBron‚Äù is currently
        listed for 10,000 ETH which is ~$16 M.
      </p>

      <p>
        NBA Top Shot works on the Flow blockchain from Dapper Labs and allows
        people to own, sell and trade official digital collectible NFTs of the
        NBA and WNBA‚Äôs greatest plays and players. Meanwhile, SoRare and
        Fancraze do the same for Football and Cricket respectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what are we at TIAR doing? TIAR just signed a 10-year NFT deal with
        the Indian Boxing Council (IBC) and WBC India. As per this deal, TIAR
        will launch NFTs involving artwork, player profiles and key moments of
        the sport. This 10-year revenue-sharing model will generate monetary
        value for boxers, promoters and other stakeholders involved in the
        professional boxing ecosystem in India.
      </p>

      <p>
        IBC president Brigadier (Retd) PK Muralidharan Raja said that he
        believes this partnership between TIAR and IBC will introduce a steady
        source of passive income for the boxers, and the promoters will get a
        whole new channel of revenue too.
      </p>

      <p>
        But where do we get these moments from? Indian professional boxing
        matches do not get the same attention and hype from the fans, because
        they do not even know they‚Äôre being played. The streaming, the coverage
        and the exposure given to boxing compare nothing to what other
        league-based sports in India get. And this presents an opportunity to
        organize a professional and world-class boxing league.
      </p>

      <p>
        What does TIAR do? We grab this opportunity with both hands. TIAR is
        planning, organizing and presenting to you all, a one-of-its-kind
        professional boxing league wherein boxers from all over the country will
        fight it out for the coveted title, helped and mentored by
        world-renowned coaches.

        When we think of sports in India, in recent times there have been huge
        developments and masses favoring not just commercial sports like cricket
        but also national icons like Vijender Singh, Mary Kom, Neeraj Chopra and
        Lovlina Borgohain have ignited a spark of sports like Boxing and Javelin
        too.
      </p>

      <p>
        TIAR identified that Boxing is a hugely followed sport worldwide and it
        was time India started producing revenue and applauded the world-class
        Indian boxers, and make the general public more aware and excited about
        it. We have heard names like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Evander
        Holyfield, etc. who were famous all over the world for their records,
        knockouts and punches and rose to fame via World Boxing Council‚Äôs (WBC)
        events and championship title matches. There was, is and always will be
        a huge fan following to this game of boxing, wherein a huge amount of
        respect, money and fame is earned by these professional boxers owing to
        the way the sport is treated and glorified over the world. India however
        lacks in this aspect.
      </p>

      <p>
        What did TIAR do? It became the very first company to bring WBC to
        India. TIAR aims to promote boxing through live events and pay-per-view
        streaming, leading to an ‚ÄúIndian Boxing League‚Äù.
      </p>

      <p>
        TIAR along with Indian Boxing Council (IBC) and WBC was able to
        successfully host the nation‚Äôs first WBC India and WBC Asia Silver Title
        matches on 5th December 2021 in the iconic Gachibowli Stadium,
        Hyderabad. There were 5 matches that were fought on the night, which was
        titled Hellsbay. The WBC Asia Silver title was fought between Karthik
        Sathish and Heru Purwanto, which was won by Karthik. Chennai‚Äôs Sabari
        became the inaugural winner of the WBC India welterweight title,
        defeating the more experienced Akashdeep Singh of Chandigarh. There were
        3 other matches under IBC which were fought between Asad Asif Khan and
        Nasoro Madimba, Gurpreet Singh and Lokesh Dangi, Manikandan V and Mazhar
        Hussain.
      </p>

      <p>
        The event marked the beginning of what looks like a bright and
        successful collaboration between the Indian Boxing Council and the World
        Boxing Council, who have teamed up to take boxing in India to another
        level. The significance of the night could be conveyed through the fact
        that the two WBC titles are going to be fought for in years to come, and
        5th December 2021 marked the day they were first conquered.
      </p>

      <p>
        This entire event was live-streamed on Hellsbay, TIAR‚Äôs own OTT
        Platform.
